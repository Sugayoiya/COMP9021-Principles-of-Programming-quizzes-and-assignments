##### quiz1

```
Generates a list L of random nonnegative integers smaller than the length of L,
whose value is input by the user, and outputs two lists:
- a list M consisting of L's middle element, followed by L's first element,
  followed by L's last element, followed by L's second element, followed by
  L's penultimate element...;
- a list N consisting of L[0], possibly followed by L[L[0]], possibly followed by
  L[L[L[0]]]..., for as long as L[L[0]], L[L[L[0]]]... are unused, and then,
  for the least i such that L[i] is unused, followed by L[i], possibly followed by
  L[L[i]], possibly followed by L[L[L[i]]]..., for as long as L[L[i]], L[L[L[i]]]...
  are unused, and then, for the least j such that L[j] is unused, followed by L[j],
  possibly followed by L[L[j]], possibly followed by L[L[L[j]]]..., for as long as
  L[L[j]], L[L[L[j]]]... are unused... until all members of L have been used up.
```


##### quiz2

```
Generates a list L of random nonnegative integers, the largest possible value
and the length of L being input by the user, and generates:
- a list "fractions" of strings of the form 'a/b' such that:
    . a <= b;
    . a*n and b*n both occur in L for some n
    . a/b is in reduced form
  enumerated from smallest fraction to largest fraction
  (0 and 1 are exceptions, being represented as such rather than as 0/1 and 1/1);
- if "fractions" contains then 1/2, then the fact that 1/2 belongs to "fractions";
- otherwise, the member "closest_1" of "fractions" that is closest to 1/2,
  if that member is unique;
- otherwise, the two members "closest_1" and "closest_2" of "fractions" that are closest to 1/2,
  in their natural order.

##### quiz3

```
# Randomly generates a grid with 0s and 1s, whose dimension is controlled by user input,
# as well as the density of 1s in the grid, and finds out, for given step_number >= 1
# and step_size >= 2, the number of stairs of step_number many steps,
# with all steps of size step_size.
#
# A stair of 1 step of size 2 is of the form
# 1 1
#   1 1
#
# A stair of 2 steps of size 2 is of the form
# 1 1
#   1 1
#     1 1
#
# A stair of 1 step of size 3 is of the form
# 1 1 1
#     1
#     1 1 1
#
# A stair of 2 steps of size 3 is of the form
# 1 1 1
#     1
#     1 1 1
#         1
#         1 1 1
#
# The output lists the number of stairs from smallest step sizes to largest step sizes,
# and for a given step size, from stairs with the smallest number of steps to stairs
# with the largest number of stairs.

Solving a **sudoku puzzle** is a very common assignment; it is not difficult and moderately interesting as
a “solution” (the completed grid) tells nothing about how the solution was reached. More interesting
solvers are logical in the sense that they (possibly partially only) solve the puzzle in steps and at every
step, explain how they made some progress; they do so by using some of the well known techniques that
most people who solve sudoku puzzles apply. Two remarks are in order.
